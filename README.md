**setr_style_3DSegmentation.ipynb**: proof of concept for extending SETR-like transformer for 3D segmentation. Here, I used a 3D-ViT implementation from ViT-Pytorch as encoder for volumetric inputs and a 3D-CNN based decoder. Dummy dataset of 3D cubes with a sphere on the inside for training and inference.
